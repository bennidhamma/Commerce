How To Play Commerce! A Game of Trade And Governance.
=====================================================

Commerce is a deck building game set in the age of discovery. You play the role of a colonial power, and through your deck, and te power of your civilization, you expand your empire through the discovery of new lands, and the creation of new colonies.

You begin the game with 10 Nation Cards: 5 *One Colonist* cards, 1 *Ship* card, 2 *Colony* cards, and 2 *Gold* cards. Play proceeds as a series of rounds. Each round consists of two phases - the Governance phase, and the Trading phase. In the beginning of the game, these cards are shuffled, and a starting hand of 5 cards is dealt to each player from their decks. Although the hand limit begins the game at 5, it can increase later in the game.

The Governance Phase
====================

In the Governance phase, each player receives one Turn. During a player's turn, she receives 1 Action order and 1 Buy order, although various cards allow these numbers to be increased. The player must use or lose all of her Action orders before she can use any of her Buy orders. Each Action order allows the player to play one card in her hand.

Ship cards can discover hexes. Colonist cards can be played on hexes. When the player feels she has enough colonists on a discovered hex to build a colony, she can play a colony card to attempt to build a colony there. Note that if she tries to do so with too few colonists, she runs the risk of the attempt failing, perhaps due to unfriendly natives, inclement weather, disease, and so forth.

When all players have played their Governance turn, the Governance phase ends, and the Trading phase begins.

The Trading Phase
=================

During the trading phase, aach colony produces one resource. There are nine levels of resources, and up to nine colonies can be built. The first colony to produce a resource produces a level 1 resource (Timber or Corn). The second colony produces one level 2 resource (Coffee or Rum), the third, one level 3 resource (Cotton or Tea), and so on down to nine (Ivory or Gold). 

In addition to the commodities, there are several calamities that can be dealt to players. Calamities are assocaited to trade levels, and lower level calamities tend to be less severe than higher level calamities.
